# hex-spoof

A simple script to randomize and display an infinite stream of "hexdump" output.

### but why?

After watching [27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLRLYPiaAoA), a YouTube short by [exurb1a](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCimiUgDLbi6P17BdaCZpVbg), an excellent content creator, I decided to write a similar scrolling wall of gibberish, with the only real goal of sequencing output such that it presented a believable rate consistent with a processor under varying load.

It's more interesting to observe than it ought to be, but that isn't saying much.
